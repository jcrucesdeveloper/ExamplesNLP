# Examples NLP

This repository contains examples of common NLP tasks using Pytorch.

Common NLP tasks demonstrated in this repository:

1. Text Classification - Sentiment analysis, topic classification, spam detection
2. Named Entity Recognition (NER) - Identifying entities like names, locations, organizations
3. Machine Translation - Converting text between languages 
4. Text Generation - Language modeling and text completion
5. Word Embeddings - Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText implementations
6. Sequence Labeling - Part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition (Third task of course NLP course 2024 FCFM)
7. N-grams and Linear Interpolation - Text processing techniques (First task of course NLP course 2024 FCFM)
8. Naive Bayes and Linear Neural Network - Text classification using Naive Bayes and Linear Neural Network (Second task of course NLP course 2024 FCFM)
9. Seq2seq translation, BERT-based next sentence prediction, masked language modeling, and question answering (Fourth task of course NLP course 2024 FCFM)
