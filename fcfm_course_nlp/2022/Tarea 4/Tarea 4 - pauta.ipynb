Son modelos discriminativos mientras que los HMMs son modelos generativos. Los modelos discriminativos modelan directamente la probabilidad condicional utilizando un modelo parametrizado, minetras que los generativos utilizan solo la probabilidad conjunta.\n","\n","#### Manejo de las palabras con baja frecuencia:\n","En lose HMMs se reemplazan las palabras poco frecuentes por categor√≠as. Para esto, se divide el vocabulario en dos subconjuntos mediante un umbral de frecuencia: uno con las palabras frecuentes y otro con las poco frecuentes. Luego se convierten las poco frecuentes a un conjunto fijo de categor√≠as, por ejemplo, las fechas, los numeros y los nombres.\n","En la fase de testing, las palabras desconocidas las podemos llevar a estas categorias en vez de solo usar el token **unk**.\n","Esto trae como ventaja una mejora en las propiedades de generalizacion del modelo.\n","\n","En los MEMMs lo que tenemos son funciones parametrizadas para los cuales se aprenden pesos. Dado esto, el input se trata como un vector de caracteristicas (features). \n","Los inputs de los MEMMs incluyen la etiqueta. Esto tiene como ventaja que perimite codificar relaciones m√°s directas entre la etiqueta y el input. \n","Estas relaciones se determinan mediante el uso de $\\phi(\\cdot, \\cdot)$\n","\n","#### Decisiones globales de los CRFs, diferencias con respecto a los HMMs y MEMMs:\n","En los CRFs la normalizaci√≥n es global, mientras que en los MEMMs la normalizaci√≥n en local. Esto hace que entrenar una MEMMs es menos complicado que entrenar los CRFs.\n","\n","La gran ventaja de CRFs sobre MEMMs es que puede resolver un problema que se llama label bias. Este problema se da porque para algunas configuraciones de las etiquetas las MEMMs pueden ignorar informacion importante del contexto al realizar decisiones independientes en cada paso.
